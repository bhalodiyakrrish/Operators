# Operators
Operators in Python are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables and values. They are fundamental to programming as they allow you to manipulate data and control the flow of your code. Here are the main types of operators in Python:

# 1. Arithmetic Operators
These operators are used to perform common mathematical operations:
Addition (+): Adds two operands.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.
Division (/): Divides the first operand by the second.
Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division.
Exponentiation (**): Raises the first operand to the power of the second.
Floor Division (//): Divides and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result.

# 2. Assignment Operators
These operators are used to assign values to variables:
Assignment (=): Assigns the right-hand operand to the left-hand operand.
Add and Assign (+=): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
Subtract and Assign (-=): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
Multiply and Assign (*=): Multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
Divide and Assign (/=): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

# 3. Comparison Operators
These operators compare two values and return a boolean result:
Equal to (==): Returns True if both operands are equal.
Not equal to (!=): Returns True if operands are not equal.
Greater than (>): Returns True if the left operand is greater than the right.
Less than (<): Returns True if the left operand is less than the right.
Greater than or equal to (>=): Returns True if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right.
Less than or equal to (<=): Returns True if the left operand is less than or equal to the right.

# 4. Logical Operators
These operators are used to combine conditional statements:
Logical AND (and): Returns True if both statements are true.
Logical OR (or): Returns True if one of the statements is true.
Logical NOT (not): Reverses the result, returns False if the result is true.

# 5. Identity Operators
These operators compare the memory locations of two objects:
is: Returns True if both variables are the same object.
is not: Returns True if both variables are not the same object.

# 6. Membership Operators
These operators test for membership in a sequence (like lists, strings, or tuples):
in: Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object.
not in: Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object.

# 7. Bitwise Operators
These operators are used to perform bit-level operations:
AND (&): Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
OR (|): Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1.
XOR (^): Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1.
NOT (~): Inverts all the bits.
Left Shift (<<): Shifts bits to the left by pushing zeros in from the right.
Right Shift (>>): Shifts bits to the right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left.
